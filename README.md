# tic-tac-toe-with-power-ups
Choose the number of rows and columns for the board. Play like classic Tic-Tac-Toe: take turns marking spaces to align a row, column, or diagonal of your symbols. Some spaces have power-ups: Repeat Move gives an extra turn, Add Symbol places an extra symbol, and Swap Symbol changes an opponent's symbol to yours.
